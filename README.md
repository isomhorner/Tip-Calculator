# Tip-Calculator
Calculator - shows importance of data types for variables


#You have the bill, tip, and people variables that rely on the user input
#the variable also convert the user inputs as float (w/ decimal digits) and integers (whole #s)
##variables .... instead of a default string variable
###this is important for later equation-based outputs



#tip_perperson shows how much each person should tip, rounded to the tenth decimal digit (hence, the , 2 indication)
#bill_total shows the total amount the bill is, with everyone tipping, rounded to the tenth decimal digit
#bill_perperson shows how much each person should chip in, with their tip included, for the bill to be divvy'd up between
##everyone



#You create the output altogether, making the
#per-person-tip and -bill variables are a string to bypass the ultimate 'string/integer' error
#Then, you create the output for bill_perperson, showing how you can also do the f-string instead of str()
